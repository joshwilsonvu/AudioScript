TODO
Bugs
1. use QObject::disconnect to take care of closing errors where emitted signals like changed() cause slots to be called on destroyed objects
2. fix replacement in files so that the entered class name actually replaces CLASSNAME in the default file
Future
3. replace qt class forward declaration preoptimizations with #include directives--include everything necessary for each file,
   the preprocessor will skip repeated includes and removing an include from one file won't break others
4. create a class list widget in which double-clicking opens the class
5. implement audioscriptcompiler, code to produce libraries for audioscriptlibrary to load--and ~get minimum viable product working~
6. modularization; try to refactor some of the specific functionality of MainWindow to other classes
6.5. no globals (done pretty good so far)
7. documentation
8. create a window for compiler feedback, use within AudioScriptCompiler
9. make sure all member data fields are prefixed with "m_"

10. create a streamlined, academic, consistent way to connect frontend and backend
